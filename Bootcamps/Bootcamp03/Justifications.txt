Integer

Advantages: 
1. primitive data type
2. can used functions such as toString() to convert the integer to string

Disadvantages:
1. Might be difficult to concatenate
2. If clientId includes some character other than integer, the program will fail


String

Advantages:
1. We can include any character we want 

Disadvantages:
1. As it is not a primitive data type, it might consume more memory space


Decision:
I have decided to use integer because it consumes less memory space as it is primitve, 
and it is easier to work with; for example when comparing. An integer can be compared directly
whereas a string needs to be compared using String.equals()
