1. In the edu.monash.fit2099.CarAuction class, a method clientList which contain 3 nested for loops must be created

2. Before the 1st loop, an arraylist with integer data type is created. The arraylist will be used to store all clientIds which
   have already been printed out.

3. The 1st for loop will loop over the cars arraylist for i = 0 to i < cars.size() times. 

4. The 2nd for loop iterates over every bid of each class in the cars arraylist for  j = 0 to j < cars.get(i).bids.size()

5. In the 2nd loop, the clientId is printed using the description() method and it is added to the arraylist created in step 2

6. The clientId is checked against existing elements of the arraylist using the 3rd for loop. If the clientId is not present there, it
   is printed out to the string, else it is ignored
